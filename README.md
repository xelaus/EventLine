# EventLine
## YHacks 2015

EventLine queries the largest event database and booking website in the world - EventBrite. Users are able to search by a key word being either and event name, the name of the performer/ speaker, or the city name. After a date range is chosen, all events that fit the search criteria appear on the screen. Users can view each event, book the event directly, or choose to see a summary of the event directly out our website. If user does chose to book the event, they can also go ahead and book a hotel directly our our site that is within close proximity to the event location. The user will be prompted to input check-in and check-out after which a search query will be displayed of all hotels within the area. The query can then be filtered by price, star rating, or amenities. The price, description, star rating, and location will all be displayed within each search box for the every hotel displayed. Users can click the box they choose to pick and book the hotel directly from the site. A map option is also available showing the distance of each hotel from the event itself. All of this is done using Priceline's API.
